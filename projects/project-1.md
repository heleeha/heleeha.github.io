In this project our team developed a program for controlling one elevator with four floors. The goal of the project was to make sure the program was ready for the Factory Acceptance Test(FAT) at a given date, as well as making a good design before the implementation began, and writing good and readable code. 

The program used sensors to determine which buttons were being pushed at any time. As well as knowing in which floor the elevator was located. The elevator was supposed to behave logically and all orders needed to be served. It also needed to meet some specified requirements, like how it should behace when the stop button was pushed or if there was a door obstruction. 

In the beginning of the project we desiged our program using UML. We desiged the different modules such that they had high cohesion and as low coupling as possible. Ater the design was finished we implemented the code.

I was in a team with one other person and we did most of the project together and contributed the same amount. We distributed the workload between us and discussed if there were any issues.
