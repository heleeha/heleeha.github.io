UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

For this assignment, create an engaging and informative essay about UI Frameworks. You might want to discuss some of the issues raised above, as well as your own personal experience with Semantic UI. Or perhaps youâ€™ve also used another framework such as Twitter Bootstrap. In that case, it might be interesting to read your perspective on a comparison of the two.

This essay is tailor made to include an image of a web page built with a UI framework (or even a comparison of web pages built with and without a UI framework).

This week I experienced using UI frameworks for the first time. I learned the concepts of and tried making a cople of web pages using Semantic UI. Semantic UI 
is a front-end development framework designed for theming. It contains pre-built semantic components that helps create beautiful and responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML. I found it really difficult to learn and because I am quite new to HTML and CSS as well, I find it all quite confusing.
