I am very interested in technology, I have always loved problem-solving and I love to use my brain for logical thinking. I have for instance always loved to solve problems like sudoku and other logical games. This is one of the reasons why I am very interested in software engineering. Software engineering is also very interesting to me as it is a broad field with many opportunities. It is also a field where you have the opportunity for continuous learning. One of the things I am passionate about is to challenge myself and learn new things. Therefore, I believe software engineering is a good fit for me, and I am excited to learn more.

Another thing I like about software engineering is that you have the opportunity to work both individually and in teams. I think it is a good thing that you have the chance to work on problems by yourself, but at the same time get help from teammates. I really enjoy working on projects in groups, I think you can learn a lot from teammates. The best projects and learning experiences I have had were in teams. I believe that working in teams you can come up with better ideas faster than on your own, by discussing problems. Because of this, I hope that I become better at working in teams and cooperate better with others when working with software engineering.

Furthermore, I hope to develop better skills within programming and learn more languages. I hope to learn the concepts and syntax of many languages such that I can easily pick up new languages. I also hope to further develop my problem-solving skills. As well as be able to quickly solve problems by designing and implementing code both by myself and in teams. I am looking forward to continuing to learn about software engineering and becoming a better developer.
