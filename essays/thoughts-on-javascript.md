As a computer-science student have had the oppertuity to decvelop software in languages like C, C++, Go, Python and Matlab. I have yet to develop software using Javascript. Therefore, I am excited to learn Javascript in the course ICS 314 Software Engineering. This time I will be learning a new programmming language using an athletic software engineering approach, I am exited to try this out and learn more about it.

## First impression of Javascript

Since Javascript is a new language to me, I began by compleating a couple of corses at the FreeCodeCamp website. I compleated the Basic Javascript and ES6 courses to learn the Javascript syntax and concepts. My first thougths was that the many functionalities and the simplicity of the language. Being a 4th year computer-science student I have some experience with other languages and it is natural to campare Javascript to these.  The concepts, like first-class functions, of Javascript seem quite similar to python. It is also similar to python in the way that you do not have to define what type the variables are. But the syntax seems closer to C++ as you need ";" at the end of most lines and for loops are basically the same. 

I like Javascript as the syntax is easy and from my understanding it is versatile and has the power to create apps for back end, front end, mobile and desktop.
I also enjoy the ES6 which was the second major revision of Javascript that came in 2015. ES6 makes the code more modern and readable. I like that you are able to differentiate between constant variables and variables that change by using "const" and "let". This makes it easier to make sure that I do not change any variables that I want to be constant.

## Athletic Software Engineering

Athletic software engineering is the concept of practicing software in the same way that you would practice a sport, by doing a little every day instead of 10 hours in one session. I enjoy this way of learning, I both learn faster and remember more of what I have learned. The practice WODs are useful as I get to test my knowledge and abilities. I can easily see if I manage to do the problems faster or slower than average. I enjoy this learning strategy and think it will work well for me. I am looking forward to continuing learning using athletic software engineering.
