In the course ICS 314 Software Engineering I am learning the coding language Javascript and using an athletic software engeneering approach.

Javascript is a new language to me. I did the FreeCodeCamp Basic Javascript and ES6 courses to learn the Javascript syntax and concepts. Some of the languages I have previously coded in are python, matlab and C++. The concepts, like first-class functions, of Javascript seem quite similar to python. But the syntax is seems closer to C++ as you need ";" at the end of most lines and for loops are the same as in C++. I like Javascript as the syntax is easy and from my understanding it is versatile and has the power to create apps for back end, front end, mobile and desktop. 

I also like the ES6 as it makes the code more modern and readable. I like that you are able to differentiate between constant variables and variables that change by using "const" and "let". This makes it easier to make sure that I do not change any variables that I want to be constant.

Athletic software engineering is the concept of practicing software in the same way that you would practice a sport, by doing a little every day instead of 10 hours in one session. I enjoy this way of learning, I both learn faster and remember more of what I have learned. The practice WOD are usefull as I get to test my knowledge and abilities. I can easily see if I manage to do the problems faster or slower than average. I enjoy this learning strategy and think it will work well for me. I am looking forward to continuing athletic software engineering.
