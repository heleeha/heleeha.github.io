Learn the language, a lot is allowed, but may cause confusion and errors
Have a standard way makes it easyer to understand other peoples code and collaborate
Satisfaction whith the green checkmark

Coding standards is not only used to make your code pretty, they also have a lot of other purposes. 
Coding standards are collections of guidelines, coding rules and best practices. 
This week I have been trying out the coding standard ESLint with IntelliJ, and I can tell you that there are few things that are more satisfying 
than getting the green check-mark when your code fully follows the ESLint standard.

## Learning with ESLint
I am currently just starting to code using Javascript. Therefore, I easily confuse the syntax with other programming languages. Using ESLint is a great way to learn 
Javascript and its best practices as I get errors if something I write is wrong or does not follow ESLint. I believe that I learn Javascript more quickly by using ESLint, 
it is easier to remember things like using three equal signs(===) instead of two(==) when you get notified each time you do it wrong.

## Becoming a better software engineer 
When I become a software engineer it is important to write code using a coding standard. I will collaborate a lot on projects with other people and having a common 
coding standard will make life a lot easier. I makes it easier to understand each others code and whole code more similar.
