Have you ever worked on a big software project, and done all the work by yourself? This may be true for many students, and they may think that it is easier to do everything alone. However, in reality in the working life, you will rarely do a project all by yourself. The projects are too big and complex, and the code will probably need maintaining and upgrading. Therefore, it is important to understand that software engineering is a lot more than only being able to make a website or an app with some lines of code. It is a whole process and being able to understand and use concepts like development environments, coding standards, user interface frameworks, and agile project management to collaborate are important parts of the process. 

## Teamwork
A big challenge when working with software engineering is to be able to collaborate well with others when working on a project. I have learned how important it is to have a common understanding of some of the fundamental software engineering concepts. When working together on a project, having the same IDEA (development environment) with the same configurations makes everything a lot easier. This goes hand in hand with coding standards. Using the same coding standard and using it in the IDEA will make it a lot easier to understand each other's code. As well as make the code look clean. One of the most difficult things when collaborating on a project is being able to divide the project between the team members. This is something I have had a lot of trouble with when working with earlier projects. However, using agile project management and issue-driven management can make the whole process go very smoothly. Dividing the project into small subtasks or issues and assigning them to different team members, makes the process go a lot faster without risking a lot of stuff being done double up. Defining goals for each milestone and setting a deadline also makes the process a lot easier. Using GitHub to collaborate and using a different branch for each issue makes it easy to have an overview and go back if something suddenly does not work. Being able to use Git is an important skill that every Software Engineer needs to have.

## Understanding the concepts
When becoming a software engineer it is important to understand a lot of different concepts. I have several times experienced getting questions like: Have you coded using open source? In what way have you used design patterns? These concepts are words that I have heard many times before, but I had never really understood the concepts. Therefore, I was forced to answer «I don’t know» even though I had used it. This shows how important it is to understand the fundamental concepts of software engineering, and that it is not just enough to know how to use it, you need to understand what you are actually doing to be able to communicate it to others.
