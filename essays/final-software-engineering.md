Software engineering is a lot more than only being able to make a website or an app with some lines of code. It is a whole process and being able to understand and use concepts like development environments, coding standards, user interface frameworks and agile project management are important parts of the process. 

A big challenge when working with software engineering is to be able to collaborate well with others when working on a project. I have learned how important it is to have a common understanding of some of the fundamental software engineering concepts. When working together on a project, having the same IDEA  (development environment) with the same configurations makes everything a lot easier. This is goes hand in hand with coding standards. Using the same coding standard and using it in the IDEA will make it a lot easier to understand each others code. As well as make the code look clean. One of the most difficult things when collaborating on a project is being able to divide the project between the team members. This is something I have had a lot of trouble with in earlier projects. However, using agile project management and issue driven management can make the whole process go very smoothly. Dividing the project into smal subtasks or issues and assigning them to different team members, makes process go a lot faster without risking a lot of stuff being done double up. Defining goals for each milestone and setting a deadline also makes the process a lot easier. Using GitHub to collaborate and using a different branch for each issue makes..

When becoming a software engineer it is important to understand a lot of different concepts. I have several times experienced getting questions like: Have you coded using open source? In what way have you used design patterns? These concepts are words that I have heard many times before, but I had never really understood the concepts. Therefore, I was forced to answer «I don’t know» even though I had used it. This shows how important it is to understand the fundamental concepts of software engineering, and that it is not just enough to know how to use it, you need to understand what you are actually doing to be able to communicate it to others.

I am very interested in technology, I have always loved problem-solving and I love to use my brain for logical thinking. I have for instance always loved to solve problems like sudoku and other logical games. This is one of the reasons why I am very interested in software engineering. Software engineering is also very interesting to me as it is a broad field with many opportunities. It is also a field where you have the opportunity for continuous learning. One of the things I am passionate about is to challenge myself and learn new things. Therefore, I believe software engineering is a good fit for me, and I am excited to learn more.

Another thing I like about software engineering is that you have the opportunity to work both individually and in teams. I think it is a good thing that you have the chance to work on problems by yourself, but at the same time get help from teammates. I really enjoy working on projects in groups, I think you can learn a lot from teammates. The best projects and learning experiences I have had were in teams. I believe that working in teams you can come up with better ideas faster than on your own, by discussing problems. Because of this, I hope that I become better at working in teams and cooperate better with others when working with software engineering.

Furthermore, I hope to develop better skills within programming and learn more languages. I hope to learn the concepts and syntax of many languages such that I can easily pick up new languages. I also hope to further develop my problem-solving skills. As well as be able to quickly solve problems by designing and implementing code both by myself and in teams. I am looking forward to continuing to learn about software engineering and becoming a better developer.
