- Do research before asking questions. Search on Google first, then on Stack Exchange sites to see if any one else has had the same question or problem as you.
- Try to inspect your code or experiment to try to find out why the problem is occurring.
- Ask a friend that is skilled.
- Find the right forum for your question.
- Make spesific headlines that are meaningful.
- Use language that is clear and grammatically correct without spelling mistakes.
- Be precise about the problem
- Be courteous

When developing software there will always be problems or challanges that you meet. Personally I have had many problems and questions throughout my studies so far. There are a lot of possibilities to get help 
and many people who are willing to spend time helping you. At the ame time people are more willing to be helpfull if you ask questions in a smart way. You will also probably find the answer to your question a lot faster if you ask them the right way. Some guidelines to asking smart questions are written by [Eric Raymond](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). There are many ways and places to ask questions, one of them is the Stack Exchange site StackOverFlow.

## A smart question 

A smart question will be precise about the problem and the headline will reflect the problem well. In the question
[What is the "-->" operator in C/C++?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1642028/what-is-the-operator-in-c-c) the title reflects the problem well and it is spesific and meaningful. The question in itself is precise and shows an example of some code and output. The question is also concise and uses clear language. All of this makes the question easy to read and understand. The question has gotten a lot of upvotes and sevral answers, which shows that this indeed is a smart question.

## Not the smartest question
Some questions posted on sites like StackOverFlow are not asked in a smart way. This will often lead to confusion and misunderstandings between the person asking and the people answering the question. In the example 
[Javascript spacebar for starting code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69109867/javascript-spacebar-for-starting-my-code), the headline does not reallly seem to reflect the actual question. The question is not "how to start code using the spacebar in Javascript?" which I would have thougth from the headline. Instead the question asks why his program, which is a flappy-bird game, activates when he hits the spacebar. The question is also written in what lookes like one very long sentence with a lot of ",". This makes the question very difficult to read and would probably lead to more misunderstandings. The question does not contain any code, but instead it links to the entire github repository. This makes it very difficult for others to help, as they have to go through the entire repository trying to find the right part of the code. It is clear from the comments on this post that other people did not think this was a smart question. The first comment asks the person to take a look at a link on how to ask good questions. The second comment says that relevant code should be posted and not only the github repository.


## Before you ask
The most important thing to do before you ask questions on sites like StackOverFlow is do do research. People are less willing to help if it does not seem like you have thought about the problem before you ask it or if the same question has been asked many times before. Therefore, start by searching on Google, then on Stack Exchange sites to see if any one else has had the same question or problem as you. You should also try to inspect your code or experiment before you ask questions, sometimes you can find the problem on you own by taking some time to look it over.
