Coding standards is not only used to make your code pretty, they also have a lot of other purposes. 
Coding standards are collections of guidelines, coding rules and best practices. 
This week I have been trying out the coding standard ESLint with IntelliJ, and I can tell you that there are few things that are more satisfying 
than getting the green check-mark when your code fully follows the ESLint standard.

## Learning with ESLint
I am currently just starting to code using Javascript. Therefore, I easily confuse the syntax with other programming languages. Using ESLint is a great way to learn 
Javascript and its best practices as I get errors if something I write is wrong or does not follow ESLint. I believe that I learn Javascript more quickly by using ESLint, it is easier to remember things like using three equal signs(===) instead of two(==) when you get notified each time you do it wrong.

## Becoming a better software engineer 
When I become a software engineer it is important to write code using a coding standard. I will collaborate a lot on projects with other people and having a common 
coding standard will make life a lot easier. I makes it easier to understand each others code and makes the whole code for the project more similar. When becoming a software engineer it is also important to write code that is easy to maintain and debug for others.
