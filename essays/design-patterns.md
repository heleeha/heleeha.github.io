“What are design patterns?”, followed by “What design patterns have you used in your own code?”

Design patterns is a vague concept that is difficult to grasp. After watching a couple of videos and searching the internet for a while, I finally feel like 
I have an understanding of what design patterns actually are. To sum it up I would say; 
reusable solutions that are typical to commonly occuring problems in software design are called design patterns. 
We can say that the patterns are templates that can be costumized to solve a spesific design problem, and they are best practices for solving common problems.
Desig patterns originate from Cristopher Alexander, in 1977 he wrote that a design pattern "describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."

Design patterns can be categorized into creational patterns, structural patterns and behavioral patterns.

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.
This past week I experienced using UI frameworks for the first time. I learned the concepts of Semantic UI and tried making a couple of web pages using it. Semantic UI is a front-end development framework designed for theming. It contains pre-built semantic components that help create modern and responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML. I found it really difficult to learn, and because I am quite new to HTML and CSS as well I found it all a bit confusing. Learning UI Frameworks for the first time can take some time and you need to put in a bit of effort, but when you have learned your first UI Framework it is easier to learn other UI Frameworks.
